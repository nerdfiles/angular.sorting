#angular.sorting

A series of modalities on sorting points in linear-time, using trigonometric 
functions and sacred geometry as a basis for iterative study on the 
corpuscular formative-performative inherence of segmentational point lattice
dynamics.

## Villard

Finding min Y as it applies to determination of molecular sums. How far can 
a particle travel in a stochastic time collision cadence? Approximation 
positionality of electron statistical distance generational modeling.

We will use iterative expansions of “Villard space” to build a projection 
calculus for 3D dimensional series normalization forms, using linear-time 
which may imply a stochastic ecosystem of unit rays to express trans-
extensionality as a definitional norm for translational invariance.

Some bearing is required/assumed.
